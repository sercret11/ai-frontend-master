# Prompt and Output Examples

**P3**
Tags: reference, examples

Example prompt patterns:
- \"Implement this feature in existing React module, keep current API stable.\"
- \"Refactor prompt routing logic and add regression tests.\"

Expected response style:
- Concrete file-level changes
- Verification commands and key outputs
- Residual risk callouts if any checks were skipped
