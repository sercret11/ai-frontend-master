# Creator Visual Language

**P1**
Tags: creator, visual, typography, color

- Define an explicit typography ladder (display, heading, body, caption).
- Use contrast-safe color roles for foreground, surface, accent, and semantic states.
- Keep spacing systematic using a small scale (e.g., 4/8/12/16/24/32).
- Motion should support comprehension, not decoration.
